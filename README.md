Life Visualization - Your Journey Since the Wood Paneling Era

A beautiful, interactive visualization of your life in weeks, complete with cultural context and personal milestones. 

Born from the era of disco and large lapels, my absolute bordeom, and unused builder.io credits that were going to be lost if I didn't use them, this project maps a personal journey alongside major world events and cultural moments.


Features

Interactive Timeline: Each colorful square represents a week of your life since the wood paneling era

Cultural Context: Major world events, movies, music, and technology milestones mapped to your timeline

Personal Milestones: Your achievements integrated seamlessly with world history

Since Last Visit: Dynamic stats showing what's happened since you last checked

Decade Breakdowns: Comprehensive cultural context for each decade of your life

Privacy-Friendly: Uses snarky references instead of specific dates for better privacy

Customization

Acknowledgments

Inspired by the "Life in Weeks" concept

Built with love for the wood paneling era, the dawn of MTV, and mustard yellow and avocado furniture with plastic coverings

Cultural context data is sourced from various historical references through a quick search of the Internet and my limited knowledge of the eras I grew up in that didn't go up in a puff of smoke in my early 20s.
